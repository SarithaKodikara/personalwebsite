In HD mice, environmental enrichment (EE) and exercise (EX) were shown to have therapeutic impacts on the brain and associated symptoms. We hypothesize that these housing interventions modulate the gut microbiome, configuring one of the mechanisms that mediate their therapeutic effects observed in HD. We exposed R6/1 mice to a protocol of either EE or EX, relative to standard-housed control conditions, before the onset of gut dysbiosis and motor deficits. We characterized gut structure and function, as well as gut microbiome profiling using 16S rRNA sequencing. Multivariate analysis identified specific orders, namely Bacteroidales, Lachnospirales and Oscillospirales, as the main bacterial signatures that discriminate between housing conditions. Our findings suggest a promising role for the gut microbiome in mediating the effects of EE and EX exposures, and possibly other environmental interventions, in HD mice.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Gene-environment-gut interactions in Huntington's disease mice are associated with environmental modulation of the gut microbiome","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1611878400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611914841,"objectID":"35e553e7630dbc6dd4ef7fa26de8207c","permalink":"https://saritha.rbind.io/post/hi-hugo/","publishdate":"2021-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hi-hugo/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Hi Hugo","type":"post"},{"authors":["Saritha Kodikara","Haydar Demirhan","Yan Wang","Lewi Stone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607904000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607904000,"objectID":"6228959ad7764ae6de3a1521758843d0","permalink":"https://saritha.rbind.io/publication/inferring-extinction-date-of-a-species-using-nonhomogeneous-poisson-processes-with-a-changepoint/","publishdate":"2020-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/inferring-extinction-date-of-a-species-using-nonhomogeneous-poisson-processes-with-a-changepoint/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian methods have been developed for inferring the true year of extinction of a species from sighting records that have both certain and uncertain sightings. These methods typically make the restrictive assumption that all sighting types (i.e. certain, valid uncertain, invalid uncertain) derive from independent homogeneous Poisson processes. In this study, the constant rate assumption in the homogeneous Poisson process is relaxed by allowing certain and uncertain sightings to follow independent non-homogeneous Poisson processes. The model can thus identify whether or not any of the sighting rates were increasing, decreasing or constant. In addition, a change-point is introduced to model the uncertain sightings, where the sighting rates before and after the change-point vary. We have used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to generate the posterior distributions for model parameters including species extinction time. The proposed method was applied to the sighting records of the black-footed ferret (*Mustela nigripes*) and the Ivory-billed Woodpecker (IBW; *Campephilus principalis*) species. Based on a hypothesis test, the results of the model indicate that the species both species have gone extinct and the time this occurred is inferred.  Moreover, a decline in the certain sighting rate was also inferred for both these species, possibly indicating the decrease in the species abundance as it converges to extinction. Thus, earlier model that assumes a constant sighting rate may well be biased.  Uncertain sightings rates for the IBW were found to increase before extinction (indicating possibly some additional ecological attention received near extinction) and remained constant after extinction.","tags":"Source Themes","title":"Inferring extinction date of a species using non‐homogeneous Poisson processes with a change‐point","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saritha Kodikara","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The challenging part of developing these models lies in the inclusion of uncertain sightings. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical approach to infer the extinction time of a species based on historical sighting records which may be either certain or uncertain. The posterior distribution for extinction time is evaluated using the likelihood of sighting data and non-informative priors for model parameters. All the models discussed in this paper are implemented in JAGS, a program for analyzing Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. A general methodology is presented, and it is then applied to the sighting record of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker (IBW)  (*Campephilus principalis*) . It was found that the IBW most likely went extinct between 1940 and 1945, a little after the date of the last certain sighting.  Interestingly, for the IBW dataset, the inclusion of uncertain sightings did not significantly change the inference about the extinction date. We explore the important role of the last certain sighting when estimating the extinction date. When estimating the extinction date of a species it is important to understand the role of the last certain sighting. If there are no uncertain sightings in the sighting record then the species is highly likely to go extinct soon after the last certain sighting.  Nevertheless, this can change when there are uncertain sightings. We find that extinction is likely to have occurred either close to the last certain sighting or at the time where the rate of uncertain sightings drops, as determined by our analysis.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Inferring extinction year using a Bayesian approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colin J.Thompson","Saritha Kodikara","Mark A.Burgman","Haydar Demirhan","Lewi Stone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"e5bda017f63f4bed525f55070b9c2347","permalink":"https://saritha.rbind.io/publication/using-survival-theory-models-to-quantify-extinctions/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/using-survival-theory-models-to-quantify-extinctions/","section":"publication","summary":"Extinctions are difficult to observe and typically are inferred from the timing and reliability of field observations and collections. Recent advances in approaches to estimating extinction probability consider the type, timing and certainty of records, the timing, scope and severity of threats, and the timing, extent and reliability of surveys. Here we describe a new approach to inference of extinction that uses survival theory, an approach that has a long history of effective use in other disciplines that confront similar problems. The model takes into account uncertainties in input parameter estimates and provides bounds on estimates of the extinction probability for the case in which a species has not been detected following some specified time. We illustrate application of the model using information for dodos and Aldabra snails. This approach provides an alternative perspective on the models underlying the techniques for inferring extinction. It should provide reliable estimates of recent extinction rates.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Using survival theory models to quantify extinctions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Different foundational assumptions can lead to different interpretations of data and potentially to different conclusions. To explore the implications of alternative formulations, here we develop and illustrate a Bayesian Updating method for inferring extinction based on records of observations and surveys. We illustrate how it combines incidental sightings and surveys with a data set for the Alaotra Grebe, showing how estimates of extinction may be updated as new data arise, providing a means for managers to reassess priorities for survey and management dynamically.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bayesian updating to estimate extinction from sequential observation data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saritha Kodikara","Haydar Demirhan","Lewi Stone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1523059200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523059200,"objectID":"a71e2a375df08e247ad2cfdb2352535e","permalink":"https://saritha.rbind.io/publication/inferring-about-the-extinction-of-a-species-using-certain-and-uncertain-sightings/","publishdate":"2018-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/inferring-about-the-extinction-of-a-species-using-certain-and-uncertain-sightings/","section":"publication","summary":"Sighting record of species is often used to infer the extinction of species. Most of these sightings have uncertain validity. Solow and Beet(2014, On uncertain sightings and inference about extinction. Conservation Biology 28:1119-1123) developed two models using a Bayesian approach which allowed for uncertainty in the sighting record by formally incorporating  both certain and uncertain sightings, but in different ways. Interestingly, the two methods give completely different conclusions concerning the extinction of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. We further examined these two methods to provide a mathematical explanation to explore in more depth as to why the results differed from one another. As a result, it was found that the first model was more sensitive to the last uncertain sighting, while the second was more sensitive to the last certain sighting. The difficulties in choosing the appropriate model are discussed.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Inferring about the extinction of a species using certain and uncertain sightings","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://saritha.rbind.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
