**Hello, and welcome!** I'm a research fellow in [Computational Genomics & Statistics](https://sites.research.unimelb.edu.au/integrative-genomics) at the University of Melbourne School of Mathematics and Statistics. I earned my PhD in Statistics from RMIT University, Australia, under the supervision of Professor Lewi Stone, 
Dr Haydar Demirhan and Dr Yan Wang. 

My research interests include applications of statistics in ecology and biology. I work in the [Le Cao Lab](https://lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au/#tabmain) on a project that develop statistical techniques on microbial communities. Learn more about my research interests in [publications](publication).
