abstract: Fecal samples are frequently used to characterize bacterial populations of the gastrointestinal tract. A protocol is provided to profile gut bacterial populations using rodent fecal samples. We describe the optimal procedures for collecting rodent fecal samples, isolating genomic DNA, 16S rRNA gene V4 region sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses. This protocol includes detailed instructions and example outputs to ensure accurate, reproducible results and data visualization. Comprehensive troubleshooting and limitation sections address technical and statistical issues that may arise when profiling microbiota.
