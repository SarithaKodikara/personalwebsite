abstract: The microbiome is a complex ecosystem of interdependent taxa that has traditionally been studied through cross-sectional studies. However, longitudinal microbiome studies are becoming increasingly popular. These studies enable researchers to infer taxa associations towards the understanding of coexistence, competition, and collaboration between microbes across time. Traditional metrics for association analysis, such as correlation, are limited due to the data characteristics of microbiome data (sparse, compositional, multivariate). Several network inference methods have been proposed, but have been largely unexplored in a longitudinal setting. We introduce LUPINE (LongitUdinal modelling with Partial least squares regression for NEtwork inference), a novel approach that leverages on conditional independence and low-dimensional data representation. This method is specifically designed to handle scenarios with small sample sizes and small number of time points. LUPINE is the first method of its kind to infer microbial networks across time, while considering information from all past time points and is thus able to capture dynamic microbial interactions that evolve over time. We validate LUPINE and its variant, LUPINE single (for single time point analysis) in simulated data and four case studies, where we highlight LUPINE’s ability to identify relevant taxa in each study context, across different experimental designs (mouse and human studies, with or without interventions, as short or long time courses). We propose different metrics to compare the inferred networks and detect changes in the networks across time, groups or in response to external disturbances. LUPINE is a simple yet innovative network inference methodology that is suitable for, but not limited to, analysing longitudinal microbiome data. The R code and data are publicly available for readers interested in applying these new methods to their studies.
